### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- Iâ€™m currently working on a project called Fixer, is a mobile plataform for studies, the main objective of this project is to develop your memory through the the virtual flash cards.
- Iâ€™m currently learning about API integration with react.js
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on the peoples studies that can't buy a course to enter in a college with my app.
